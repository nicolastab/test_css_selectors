<!--
There is an HTML-code example below that you should not edit!
Your goal is to write a CSS code that will apply the following styles:
- page background color - gray
- paragraph's text color should correspond to the text (the first one is green, the second one is blue, the last one is pink, etc.)
- the "Red centered" paragraph - background is white, text color is red, the text is centered
- the "hidden" paragraph - should not be visible

The correct result should look like this: example.png

To complete the task you should:
- Write the code in the "CSS" field (on the right)
- Check the result by clicking on the "Run" button (above)
- Save the result by clicking the "save" button
- Copy the URL of your result (from the address bar) and attach it as an answer in the survey (use the "other" field)
